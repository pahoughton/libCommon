.TH STRPTIME 3 "26 September 1994"  "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
strptime \- convert a string representation of time to a time tm structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <time.h>
.sp
.BI "char *strptime(char *" buf ", const char *" format ,
.BI "				const struct tm *" tm );

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.IX  "strptime function"  ""  "\fLstrptime()\fP \(em date and time conversion"
.B strptime(\|)
is the complementary function to
.B strftime(\|)
and converts the character string pointed to by
.I buf
to a time value, which is stored in the
.B tm
structure pointed to by
.IR tm ,
using the format specified by
.IR format .
.I format
is a character string that consists of field descriptors and text characters,
reminiscent of
.BR scanf (3).
Each field descriptor consists of a
.B %
character followd by another character that specifies the replacement for the
field descriptor.
All other characters are copied from
.I format
into the result.
The following field descriptors are supported:
.RS
.TP
.B %%
same as
.B %
.TP
.B %a
.PD 0
.TP
.B %A
day of week, using locale's weekday names; either the abbreviated or full name
may be specified
.PD
.TP
.B %b
.PD 0
.TP
.B %B
.TP
.B %h
month, using locale's month names; either the abbreviated or full name
may be specified
.PD
.TP
.B %c
date and time as %x %X
.TP
.B %C
date and time, in locale's long-format date and time representation
.TP
.B %d
.PD 0
.TP
.B %e
day of month (1-31; leading zeroes are permitted but not required)
.PD
.TP
.B %D
date as %m/%d/%y
.TP
.B %H
.PD 0
.TP
.B %k
hour (0-23; leading zeroes are permitted but not required)
.PD
.TP
.B %I
.PD 0
.TP
.B %l
hour (0-12; leading zeroes are permitted but not required)
.PD
.TP
.B %j
day number of year (001-366)
.TP
.B %m
month number (1-12; leading zeroes are permitted but not required)
.TP
.B %M
minute (0-59; leading zeroes are permitted but not required)
.TP
.B %p
locale's equivalent of
.SM AM
or
.SM PM
.TP
.B %r
time as %I:%M:%S %p
.TP
.B %R
time as %H:%M
.TP
.B %S
seconds (0-61; leading zeroes are permitted but not required. Extra second
allowed for leap years)
.TP
.B %T
time as %H:%M:%S
.TP
.B %w
weekday number (0-6) with Sunday as the first day of the week 
.TP
.B %x
date, using locale's date format
.TP
.B %X
time, using locale's time format
.TP
.B %y
year within century (0-99; leading zeroes are permitted but not required.
Unfortunately this makes the assumption that we are stuck in the 20th
century as 1900 is automatically added onto this number for the tm_year
field)
.TP
.B %Y
year, including century (for example, 1988)
.RE
.LP
Case is ignored when matching items such as month or weekday names.
.LP
The broken-down time structure \fItm\fP is defined in \fI<time.h>\fP
as follows:
.sp
.RS
.nf
.ne 12
.ta 8n 16n 32n
struct tm
{
	int	tm_sec;			/* seconds */
	int	tm_min;			/* minutes */
	int	tm_hour;		/* hours */
	int	tm_mday;		/* day of the month */
	int	tm_mon;			/* month */
	int	tm_year;		/* year */
	int	tm_wday;		/* day of the week */
	int	tm_yday;		/* day in the year */
	int	tm_isdst;		/* daylight saving time */
};

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBstrptime()\fP function returns a pointer to the character following 
the last character in the string pointed to by
.I buf
\.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR strftime "(3), " time "(2), " setlocale "(3), " scanf (3)
.SH BUGS
.LP
The return values point to static data,
whose contents are overwritten by each call.
.SH NOTES

This function is only available in libraries newer than version 4.6.5
.PP
The function supports only those locales specified in
.BR locale "(7)"
