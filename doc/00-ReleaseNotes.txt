Version 2.02.01 -

    Added strptime

	  There is quite a bit of inconsistancy in the versions of
	  strptime provided by the different operating systems. So, I
	  decided the best solution is to include a version (based on
	  GNU) that would provide the same functionallity across all
	  OS's.

    Changed Logger LOG_BY_DATE to create filenames with 4 digit years.
    
    Changed Logger to output time stamps with 4 digit years.
    	  
Version 2.01.02 - 5/7/97

    Source and header cleanup.

    Updated man pages.
    
Version 2.01.01 - 4/29/97

    Changed CommonErrorType values from C_* to ET_*

    Complete rework of error handling/processing routines.

	Remove LibError().

	Added GetErrorHandler().
	Added Error().
	Added ErrorArgs().
	Added SetError().
	Added ErrorMesg().
	Added ErrorTypeString().
	Added SET_ERROR_CLOSURE macro.
	Added ERROR macro.

    Added more LogBits.
    
    Added LogLevelSetString, LoggerSetLogFile, LoggerSetOutputLevel,
    LoggerSetDate, LoggerSetLoc, LoggerSetTee, LoggerSetFunct,
    LoggerLevel, LoggerLoc, LoggerTrim.

    Added TempFileName.

Version 2.00.00.b.04 - 10/31/95

    Changed Bool to BOOL for compatibility with libClue & libData

    Added Net2Host & Host2Net for short, long, unsigned short,
    unsigned long.  This should improve the protability of these
    functions (actually Macros).
