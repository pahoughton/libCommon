Version 2.02.01 -

    Added strptime

	  There is quite a bit of inconsistancy in the versions of
	  strptime provided by the different operating systems. So, I
	  decided the best solution is to include a version (based on
	  GNU) that would provide the same functionallity across all
	  OS's.
	  
    Added definition of TIMET_MIN & TIMET_MAX.

    Changed DateStringFromTimeT's default output format to 4 digit
    years.
    
    Changed DateStringFromTm's default output format to 4 digit
    years.

    Changed DateStringToTimeT to return TIMET_MIN (vs 0) if an invalid 
    date string is detected.
    
    Changed Logger LOG_BY_DATE to create filenames with 4 digit years.
    
    Changed Logger to output time stamps with 4 digit years.
