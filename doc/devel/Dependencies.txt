MakeConfigs 5.06 must be installed to build and install libCommon. If
it is not already installed you can use the 'setup' target of the
Makefile in the base directory. The setup target will create a
directory structure under $TOOL_DIR to install MakeConfigs and all of
it's components.

The directory structure expected by the setup target is the same for
MakeConfigs and all external libraries that use MakeConfigs. It is
based at $TOOL_DIR and defines the following direcotories.

    $TOOL_DIR/src/Tools
    $TOOL_DIR/src/Build/Tools
    $TOOL_DIR/src/Build/Libs
    $TOOL_DIR/include
    $TOOL_DIR/lib
    $TOOL_DIR/bin

Using this directory structure, libCommon should be checkout as:

    $TOOL_DIR/src/Build/Libs/libCommon-3

For more information about TOOL_DIR see the documentation in
MakeConfigs.
